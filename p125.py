#Object Oriented Programming Structure(OOPS)
> It is a programming technique that easily represent real world intities
in program.

>There are following concepts in oops:
    >Object
    >Class
    >Inheritance
    >Data Encapsulation
    >Polymorphism
    etc.

>There are following languages that implement above concepts.
    >Simula
    >Smalltask
    >C++
    >Python
    >Java
    >C#
    etc.

#Object:
--------
    >Objecct is any real world entity (Physical/logical) having data members
    & function(methods).

    exp:
        1)ac(air conditioner) as object:
            data------------>ton,brand,price,etc.
            function-------->cooling

        2)human as object:
            data------------>age,gender,name,etc.
            function-------->sleeping,thinking,eating,etc.

        3)bank account as object(logical):
            data------------>account.number,balance,type,etc.
            fuction--------->deposit,withdrow,transfer,etc.

    >An object is an instance of a class.

#class:
    >A class is a blueprint/template/design of an instances/objects.

    >A class is represent datatype in program.

#Syntax to create a class

    class classname:
        stmts

exp:
    class int:
        ...
        ...
    class float:
        ....
        ...
    class str:
        ...
        ..
    class ticket:
        ...
        ...
    class order:
        ...
        ...
    class account:
        ...
        ...

#Syntax to create object:

    objectname=classname()
