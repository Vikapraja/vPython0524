#11.Â Write a Python program to use of frozenset


a={1,2,3,4,5}
print('a=',a)
c=frozenset(a)
print('frozenset of set a=',c)


'''
1)frozensets are immutable set(like: tuple is immutable list) 
2)frozenset() is a function
3)frozenset() can't contain duplicates
4)it have functionality of set like union,intersection etc
