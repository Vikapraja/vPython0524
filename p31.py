#User Input
    #taking values from user during execution of program
    #input() can be used for this purpose

    #it waits for user input and read the value when user
    #hits enter key as string.

    #if we need to perform arithmetic operations on user input
    #then first we need to convert it into int/float.

a=input('enter 1st num=')
b=input('enter 2nd num=')
#print(a+b)
c=float(a)
d=float(b)
print(c+d)
